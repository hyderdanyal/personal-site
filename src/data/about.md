
# Intro

I am a Software Developer with interest in Full Stack Development, Artificial Intellegence, Scripting, to name a few. I love working with technologies for developing productive codework to enhance or ease the life of humans and sometimes aliens. I am particularly interested in projects that have a social need and can create a social impact, you can get in touch if you have something interesting. 

# Currently

At IBM we work to lead in the creation, development, and manufacture of the industryâ€™s most advanced information technologies and software. We translate these advanced technologies into value for our customers through our professional solutions, services and consulting businesses worldwide. I primarily work as an Application Developer but have some hands-on experience with Machine Learning.

# Some history

- In our early days we had access to Floppy Disks, Radio Tapes, Cathode Ray Tube Monitors, etc. My mom worked her whole life in IT with [AS/400](https://www.midlandinfosys.com/as400-software.html) and my dad had a Cyber Cafe back in the days. We have memories etched in Old cameras with negatives in Floppy Disks. 

- I used to play Java games with high loading time, bad performance and poor graphics on those CRT monitors when I was 5-6, I might have endangered some business for him. They were junky old computers used to access internet which was very limited and slow.

- At around 8 I had a PlayStation 2 which used CD's only and had games with slightly better graphics and UI. 

- I was damn good at Pinball, but I could always take some practice a Minesweeper.

- At around 9 we got a PSP which was so advanced it had smaller disks and memory cards and it was so fun. We were taught to mail letters rather than Email at school and drop it at the Post Box.

- HTML was a big thing when I was 13 and Java used to scare me we used to enjoy going to the computer labs for practicals once a week, creating static pages was supposed to be complicated and achievements for us. 

- At 16 I had an option to choose my interests and then came the face to face interaction with OOPs,Algorithms, C, Electronics, RDBMS, JDBC and Networking they made HTML seem so basic and were so interesting and I had a some projects in Android, Java, WordPress, etc.

- The age 15-19 had alot of Conter Strike 16 in it and some Fifa using PS3, PS4 love competing you'll anyone up for a challenge at Fifa.

- After 18 I was sure am getting a future in it, I had keen interest and practical knowledge of how everthing works, Digital Signals, Algorithms, Microprocessor Programming, Computer Science, Artificial Intellegence, Human Machine Interaction, Data Warehousing it was a rollercoaster twisted but exciting.

- At 22 am making sure it is gonna be in my life for long and can define me.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
